The R package is contained by three parts of algorithmï¼š
1.The iterative algorithm of multiple linear regression, namely gradient descent method, and the matrix method are used to improve the efficient of calculation.
2.The nonlinear least square method is used to solve the parameters of CES production function, in which the Gauss Newton iterative method is used.
3.The method of Markov Monte Carlo is used to sample multivariate normal distribution, and then the moment and integral of high-dimensional distribution can be calculated. The speed of operation is also greatly improved.
